# **Hello everyone!**

**Welcome to my GitHub account and project**

This library is not now available at PYPI, but it will...

If you want to learn what I have done for now, go to my wiki and learn how to use every module!

If you want to contribute, read the CONTRIBUTING file at the 'github stuff' folder.

Please, test this package and, if you like it, do not hesitate about contacting me to send suggestions!!
